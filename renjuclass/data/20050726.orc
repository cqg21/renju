<13:32:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in such a short time, it was hard to prepare much for you, I'm afraid
<13:33:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I will show you almost all my games from the 2nd Finnish Championship tournament played some 3 weeks ago
<13:33:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we will analyse what I did wrong at each given moment :)

<13:34:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In this year's tour, we had sadly only 5 players: me, Jussi Ikonen ( Morden ), Kari Haikonen ( nologic), Lauri Toivonen ( zathras at gameserver),
<13:34:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and Marko Pellikka
<13:35:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}since players were short, we replaced it by more games: double round robin
<13:35:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}each got 8 games
<13:35:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In earlier years,
<13:35:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I was unbeaten in domestic tournaments
<13:35:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and also won all games against other Finnish players in foreign tours also
<13:36:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this year, I had poor touch in playing, and did not expect much
<13:36:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and this is what happened, almost very badly
<13:36:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}1st game was with Marko

<13:37:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I played 16 also fast
<13:37:54>[TALK]{Torsten}16 - k7 most common
<13:37:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I was a bit worried he had seen some of my analysis here in other games
<13:38:01>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HG
<13:38:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he played same 17th as in my previous games
<13:38:15>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IF
<13:38:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I still went the same way,
<13:38:24>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JG
<13:38:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and his 19th was not the best
<13:39:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}since I have poor memory,
<13:39:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I can not recall detailly how much I calculated here

<13:39:18>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KH
<13:39:19>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LJ
<13:39:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but my attack was as shown

<13:40:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}could black block up ?

<13:41:15>[TALK]{hobbang}umm.
<13:41:31>[TALK]{Guest916}seems no
<13:41:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}interesting, no ideas anyone :)
<13:41:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe it is for homework then ? :))
<13:42:04>[TALK]{slappanu}maybe no sure win but white will have a big advantage
<13:42:09>[TALK]{Torsten}maybe white advantage too large with 23 - m11 ...
<13:42:19>[TALK]{lkogr}who is 27?
<13:42:30>[TALK]{Guest916}seems white sure win
<13:42:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ok, we will leave this for homework consideration :)

<13:42:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Marko went down

<13:43:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now,
<13:43:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I was ready to go up and win easily within some moves
<13:44:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but I was afraid of some black counter below
<13:44:12>[TALK]{xuwu}.
<13:44:15>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KL
<13:44:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if 30 like so,

<13:45:09>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JD
<13:45:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I took the danger point myself
<13:45:28>[TALK]{hobbang}good~
<13:45:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I knew he was forced to follow anyway
<13:45:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so no harm could be done
<13:45:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}white has enough power to win anywhere now
<13:46:00>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LE
<13:46:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}31 came
<13:46:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and white has easy VCT, any volunteers ?

<13:48:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}although, in that game I was lucky enough to win Ants as black,
<13:49:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I felt I could play it as white peacefully
<13:49:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}anyone recognize the pattern ?
<13:49:30>[TALK]{Torsten}yes
<13:49:31>[TALK]{hobbang}y
<13:49:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what is possibly the best black plan
<13:49:52>[TALK]{whte}h11
<13:49:52>[TALK]{hobbang}h11?
<13:50:00>[TALK]{hobbang}only move
<13:50:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<13:50:01>[TALK]{yuelee00}h11
<13:50:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}seems other moves are risky

<13:50:47>[TALK]{hobbang}i12 and g10
<13:50:53>[TALK]{skywalker}g10 is safe
<13:51:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}one thing about i12 is
<13:51:01>[TALK]{hobbang}maybe g10 is best
<13:51:03>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IL
<13:51:06>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JM
<13:51:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}response to J13

<13:51:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}g10 is indeed safer

<13:51:49>[TALK]{hobbang}down
<13:51:54>[TALK]{whte}e8
<13:51:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}hobbang is on fire :)
<13:52:00>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EH
<13:52:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}down is better yes
<13:52:04>[TALK]{hobbang}:)
<13:52:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}white can not attack much by going up, so down is best
<13:52:25>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GI
<13:52:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}21 is also best choice I think
<13:52:37>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GM
<13:52:39>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IM

<13:52:45>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EJ
<13:52:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here is often played nowadays some games
<13:53:14>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JF
<13:53:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I felt like I should not go into crazy attack
<13:53:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I make peaceful defense
<13:53:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I thought Jussi would follow since he has no clear attack
<13:53:43>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JE
<13:53:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in my game with Ants,
<13:53:51>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:53:52>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IF
<13:53:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I played 29 here
<13:54:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}creating some threat to right side
<13:54:16>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}ID
<13:54:17>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LJ
<13:54:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}like so
<13:54:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}29 would help right wing attack
<13:54:33>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JL
<13:54:33>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IL
<13:54:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JM
<13:54:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LI

<13:54:50>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:54:51>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:54:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Ants was worried of this
<13:54:58>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LJ
<13:55:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and defended
<13:55:04>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FF
<13:55:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and I got strong attack on left and won fast

<13:55:23>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:55:24>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JE
<13:55:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Jussi's 29 was not so direct help to right wing
<13:55:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I made a mistake
<13:55:41>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GE
<13:55:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and started to build attack in too fast pace
<13:55:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}a common mistake
<13:56:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}for me
<13:56:16>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FG
<13:56:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}31 is calm defense
<13:56:23>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EE
<13:56:26>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EG
<13:56:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and 33 also
<13:56:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I had wasted some materials by playing too quick
<13:56:54>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}CG
<13:56:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and 34 was final mistake
<13:57:01>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FH
<13:57:03>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FJ
<13:57:04>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FE
<13:57:04>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FF
<13:57:05>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FD
<13:57:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here my thoughts went down
<13:57:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what seemed like promising area
<13:57:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ended up kind of a flat
<13:57:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}perhaps white doesn't have strong basis after 29 yet
<13:58:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and building should be slower
<13:58:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}from here on, the game went on with quick moves
<13:58:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we were both pretty low on time
<13:58:46>[TALK]{wolfzhou}.
<13:58:51>[TALK]{Guest930}몪
<13:58:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I spent time here, but found nothing
<13:59:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}finally, after about 100 moves, Jussi won the game
<13:59:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and I was crushed
<13:59:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it was first loss to me in almost 2 years against another Finnish player
<14:00:00>[TALK]{hobbang}wow
<14:00:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and due to our tight schedule,

<14:02:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes ?
<14:03:01>[TALK]{lkogr}why not 12-k7?
<14:03:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I knew this 12th to be win
<14:03:35>[TALK]{hobbang}y
<14:03:40>[TALK]{hobbang}I agree
<14:03:43>[TALK]{whte}if 12-k7,13 will be f8
<14:03:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and figured, I would find some win within the time limit
<14:04:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}12-k7 would've been risky, as I would not have known it so well

<14:04:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I mean the outcome of the move

<14:05:22>[TALK]{Torsten}this 14 is the move :)
<14:05:28>[TALK]{hobbang}good
<14:05:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but since I knew it is win
<14:05:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and that likely white wins often by fouls

<14:08:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I went to D8 bravely
<14:08:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}knowing Lauri is not at his best in direct variations

<14:09:03>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JG
<14:09:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I saw this move, and thought "oh good, it's this one"
<14:09:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now,

<14:11:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this is not what I was going for

<14:11:51>[TALK]{Guest930}몪
<14:11:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and played 12th like so.....
<14:11:54>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FJ
<14:12:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and 13th came
<14:12:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I was thinking, this is not at all what I wanted
<14:12:32>[TALK]{Torsten}shouldn't 10 go inside the structure here?
<14:12:41>[TALK]{skywalker}g8?
<14:12:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Torsten, where

<14:13:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in my confusion I went here

<14:14:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and again I felt like what am I doing
<14:14:23>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EI
<14:14:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}then I thought ok, this 16 covers it
<14:14:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I'm back in the game
<14:14:43>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FK
<14:14:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}nonsense :)
<14:15:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}naturally black would not play 17-F9

<14:15:38>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FI
<14:15:38>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}DI
<14:15:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I lost quickly here
<14:15:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}don't remember the end

<14:17:37>[CLEAR]{GrandMaster}
<14:17:40>[TALK]{whte}couldn't white defend after 10-I6?
<14:17:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}sure somehow
<14:18:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I don't think the 10-i6 was a losing move, but
<14:18:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}playing wrongly by mirror effect confused me
<14:18:21>[TALK]{skywalker}is it passive?
<14:18:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and my games was ruined
<14:18:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}game
<14:18:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it was a mental shock, and I was still thinking about my loss earlier
<14:18:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and then I got another one
<14:19:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}After 1st day I had only 2 points, and Jussi lead with 3points
<14:19:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}2nd day I started with Kari

<14:20:18>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KH
<14:20:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I played 10th so in hope of him starting a brave attack

<14:21:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he was worried he can't find win,and gives me several useful stones

<14:22:09>[TALK]{whte}vct

<14:23:56>[TALK]{hobbang}nice~
<14:24:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}was it purely on eye-sight? :)
<14:24:04>[TALK]{Torsten}harder than expected...
<14:24:13>[TALK]{Torsten}nope, i was mistaken
<14:24:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so it was instict, later proven correct? :)
<14:24:29>[TALK]{xuwu}y
<14:24:32>[TALK]{Torsten}yes
<14:24:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}good
<14:24:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but
<14:24:41>[TALK]{Torsten}looked much easier at first
<14:24:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here was the dilemma of Kari's
<14:24:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so many white stones appearing
<14:24:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he must see the final win before making any moves
<14:25:05>[GOTO]{GrandMaster}016
<14:25:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I figured he will try

<14:25:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KC
<14:25:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LB
<14:25:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}basic problem in winning is what ?
<14:26:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I would say it is sequence
<14:26:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}sometimes we see how win might come
<14:26:36>[TALK]{Torsten}and possible cuts
<14:26:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but ruin it by playing in the wrong order
<14:26:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes, and cuts are often, though not alywa,s a consequence of wrong sequence in attack
<14:27:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}always
<14:27:08>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LD
<14:27:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}21 here was his choice
<14:27:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}probably fearing the white stones
<14:27:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JB
<14:27:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}after 22, it looked like white is free of danger
<14:28:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black is cornered and used lots of time
<14:28:17>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LC
<14:28:18>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KB
<14:28:20>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IB
<14:28:21>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JC
<14:28:21>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HE
<14:28:22>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HF
<14:28:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the attack was a failure and white wins eventually
<14:28:40>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KF
<14:28:41>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KD
<14:28:43>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FG
<14:28:44>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FI
<14:28:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but with 16th
<14:28:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I took a big risk
<14:29:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I gave him active lines and said "go on, try"
<14:29:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this time it was successful
<14:29:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe by the short time
<14:29:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but I needed 4 wins on 2nd day
<14:29:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and I needed some risks
<14:29:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}even one draw could've destroyed my plans
<14:30:01>[CLEAR]{GrandMaster}
<14:30:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}next I met Jussi
<14:30:12>[TALK]{hobbang}oh
<14:30:20>[TALK]{hobbang}second ?
<14:30:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I had to win, since he was threatening to win the championship

<14:30:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I knew he would open i5
<14:30:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and I knew he knows 4-g9 better than me
<14:30:52>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IG
<14:30:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I took it out of play
<14:31:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}forced him to a battle in variant where we are both clueless

<14:31:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so it went, and I was pleased
<14:31:39>[TALK]{hobbang}is jussi renjuclass member?
<14:31:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}not so theoretical as the other 4th
<14:31:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Jussi is Morden
<14:31:49>[TALK]{chess}F5?
<14:31:52>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GF
<14:31:58>[TALK]{hobbang}oh..I see :)
<14:32:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Jussi chose a bit closer attack
<14:32:03>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HG
<14:32:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I wanted to confuse him
<14:32:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and played inside
<14:32:21>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FG
<14:32:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}manipulating him in playing 15th here, I had a feeling he would play so

<14:32:39>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}DI

<14:32:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}with 16th I planned this position to appear
<14:32:57>[TALK]{Torsten}and lots of space to win
<14:33:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and I thought Jussi fears me anyway
<14:33:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he would think I have something below
<14:33:19>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EI
<14:33:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he won't dare to go here

<14:33:55>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HD
<14:34:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I was correct and he came down

<14:34:10>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GE
<14:34:10>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JE
<14:34:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now, the left side is not so dangerous

<14:34:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I was getting control of the whole board after a little risky thinking with 16th and 18th
<14:34:58>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EE
<14:35:00>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}DD
<14:35:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I knew he would fear the overline chance

<14:37:06>[TALK]{Torsten}yes :)
<14:37:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ended here
<14:37:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so,
<14:37:17>[TALK]{Torsten}40 - d11 also wins
<14:37:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in this game I continued my brave tactics

<14:38:09>[TALK]{Torsten}e7 is a must here?

<14:38:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes I would think so
<14:38:21>[TALK]{Guest930}몪
<14:38:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}white has tricky ways here in defence
<14:38:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and all is not lost

<14:41:41>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LI
<14:41:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but I know, that the more diredt the variant is,
<14:42:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the easier it is to get him confused somehow
<14:42:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here black has many lines open
<14:42:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}though it is not a win position
<14:42:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it gets confusing
<14:42:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is theoretical
<14:42:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I got the upper-hand now
<14:42:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I am comfortable, he is annoyed :))
<14:42:55>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KH
<14:43:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he played 18th, which is new to me, do you know this move ?
<14:43:20>[TALK]{hobbang}y
<14:43:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}hobbang, can you say is it better for either color ?
<14:44:00>[TALK]{hobbang}umm..maybe white?
<14:44:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}don't ask me, I don't know :)
<14:44:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it did look pretty good to me too
<14:44:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but I thought he played it by feeling, not by preivous experience
<14:44:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I thought, how to play to make him more nervous ?
<14:45:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}when you get nervous, you get likely to make for example useless fours
<14:45:02>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IK
<14:45:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I went here
<14:45:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I knew he would wonder to make four or not
<14:45:18>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HK
<14:45:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but he did
<14:45:22>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GL
<14:45:23>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JL
<14:45:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}later on,
<14:45:28>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:45:29>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:45:29>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:45:30>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JL
<14:45:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I thought, that maybe it would be better not to do it
<14:45:44>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HK
<14:45:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if black goes there next
<14:45:52>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KK
<14:45:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so be it
<14:46:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the right side seems hard for black to balance so, that it could use the left side effectively first
<14:46:35>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:46:35>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:46:36>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:46:37>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HK
<14:46:37>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GL
<14:46:38>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JL
<14:46:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but I had a feeling he would play it
<14:46:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now it got a bit easier for me
<14:46:54>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KJ
<14:47:11>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}MH
<14:47:22>[TALK]{Torsten}24 a mistake?
<14:47:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if white could threat right side
<14:47:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black would be thankful
<14:47:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes Torsten
<14:47:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EJ
<14:47:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black will win here
<14:47:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}thanks to keypoint E9
<14:48:05>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:48:05>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:48:06>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IL
<14:48:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so 24 is needed
<14:48:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now, should H11 be not used,
<14:48:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}white would have a threat here to win
<14:48:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}by playing four to g12
<14:48:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it would make black's plans harder
<14:48:44>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JE
<14:48:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I wanted to balance the right side and try to move to left side
<14:49:02>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KF
<14:49:03>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KE
<14:49:05>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KL
<14:49:08>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LL
<14:49:12>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IE
<14:49:14>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LH
<14:49:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here I knew MArko would have another moment
<14:49:54>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LF
<14:50:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}to play here
<14:50:01>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:50:02>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HD
<14:50:02>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GC
<14:50:03>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LF
<14:50:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}or here
<14:50:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he chose the one with the four again
<14:50:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}thinking H4_1 connection is not good to give to black
<14:50:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}although it is not so big help even
<14:51:02>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}ME
<14:51:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I played calmly again to right side
<14:51:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}knowing I can
<14:51:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Marko sensed, that right wing is safe
<14:51:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FG
<14:51:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EF
<14:51:35>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EG
<14:51:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}by playing even so
<14:51:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but he was wrong
<14:52:01>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}MF
<14:52:04>[TALK]{Torsten}:)
<14:52:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}39th surprised him
<14:52:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}although it is an obvious move to attack with
<14:52:22>[TALK]{Torsten}winning move
<14:52:25>[TALK]{hobbang}:)
<14:52:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe he calculated he can defend somehow
<14:52:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}or maybe he played 38 as a manipulation to make me follow 38
<14:52:54>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}NG
<14:52:57>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}MD
<14:53:03>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}MC
<14:53:05>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LC
<14:53:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but black wins
<14:53:21>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HG
<14:53:22>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GG
<14:53:23>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}NE
<14:53:25>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LD
<14:53:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}see ?
<14:53:43>[TALK]{Samsone}y
<14:53:47>[TALK]{Torsten}yes

<14:54:03>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:54:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Marko was thinking here,
<14:54:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe I need to go right after all
<14:54:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but it was too late
<14:54:24>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LE
<14:54:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if 38 somewhere here
<14:54:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}then black can still win
<14:54:41>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GD
<14:54:45>[TALK]{Torsten}left side
<14:54:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}atleeast here
<14:55:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}37 gives much extra power to black on left
<14:55:06>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:55:06>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:55:07>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:55:08>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:55:09>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LE
<14:55:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}how about just here ?
<14:56:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}3-f7 is useless if going to defend on right
<14:56:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}36
<14:56:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but however
<14:56:35>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EF
<14:56:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black might still get enough power by taking E6 point
<14:57:15>[TALK]{hobbang}y
<14:57:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and therefore I was feared, that white will just defend with 36th
<14:57:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}was not
<14:57:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in conclusion,
<14:58:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I managed to keep my title from last year by ending up with 6 points like Jussi,
<14:58:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}winning by co-efficient 20,5-17,5
<14:58:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}which I knew after the win over Jussi would happen if we end up in same points
<14:59:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}my 4 wins on 2nd day were the results of brave tactics and risking based on the fact, that I know well how many opponents were thinking during each given positions
<14:59:12>[TALK]{chess}-
<14:59:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}many = my
<14:59:28>[TALK]{Guest930}`
<14:59:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is an important factor in tournaments games
<15:00:00>[TALK]{hobbang}=) agree
<15:00:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if the opponent is new to you, it is hard to know his thinking
<15:00:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this year's title was the results of much luck too
<15:00:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but winning something the hard way can actually feel better than a victory gotten exactly as planned
<15:01:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Our time together is finished for today,
