<13:32:45>[TALK]{luwenzhe}YAMAGUCHI RULE 

1. First player puts 3 stones (from 26 openings, like with RIF standard rules), and at the same time, suggests how many alternative 5th moves to be made. 

2. Second player decides to swap or keep as white and plays the 4th move. 

3. When black plays the 5th move, he/she needs to play as many alternative 5th moves as suggested by tentative black when opening the game. 

4. White chooses one of the 5th moves, and plays the 6th move. 

5. Continue as RIF standard rules (with forbidden moves rule for black).

<13:33:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Thank you 8^-^9  Please read all
<13:33:45>[TALK]{state}thanks,Lu
<13:34:09>[TALK]{Aurora}I see, thanks,Lu
<13:34:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Current rule,  tentative Black put Opening and tentative White decides swap or keep turn
<13:34:54>[TALK]{luwenzhe}In a word, multiple alt. 5th moves
<13:35:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Yea
<13:35:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}English is hard for me ^-^
<13:35:30>[TALK]{Aurora}yes, more choice for 5th move
<13:35:46>[TALK]{xuwu}I see
<13:35:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In current rule,   many players use same openings.
<13:36:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}example,  this Direct 11
<13:36:11>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:36:11>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HG
<13:36:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}or This

<13:36:32>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:36:34>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JJ
<13:36:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and Direct 3
<13:37:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}many players use these 3 opening in 70% games
<13:37:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}This things can not make me interesting
<13:37:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and can not make all players happy
<13:38:20>[TALK]{Whiz}hehe
<13:38:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in Current rule,   5th move is only 2 in all openings
<13:39:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but many openings have advantage for black by only two 5th move
<13:39:26>[TALK]{luwenzhe}y
<13:39:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In Yamaguchi rule can  change the condition in each openings
<13:40:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Example,  Indirect 7

<13:42:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Black must put 4 stones in 5th move
<13:42:32>[TALK]{luwenzhe}maybe still black

<13:42:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}B  2     W   2
<13:43:10>[TALK]{ouzo}:))
<13:43:34>[TALK]{GrandMaster}This 4 players can play in Indirect 7
<13:43:35>[TALK]{kaka}w....
<13:43:44>[TALK]{Aurora}in this opening, I may chose black:)
<13:43:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Because B is 2  and W is 2
<13:44:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Aurora    Black must put 4 stones in 5th move..   oK? 8^-^8
<13:44:41>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GI

<13:49:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In current rule,  many players don't think about this situation
<13:49:23>[TALK]{jiang}i think j9 can win ,but no simple:)
<13:49:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Because,  black has 2 way in this situation for 5th moves
<13:49:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}J7   J8
<13:50:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the 2 moves make black perfect winning
<13:50:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}many players study only the 2 moves J7 J8
<13:51:23>[TALK]{Aurora}y
<13:51:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But in Yamaguchi rule,    all players must think many way in 5th 8^-^8
