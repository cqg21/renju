<14:32:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was fun! :)
<14:32:23>[TALK]{killer21st}we are lucky.
<14:32:29>[TALK]{luwenzhe}11 was not good, right?
<14:32:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it is fine move
<14:32:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is usual theory development
<14:33:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe 28 was too brave
<14:33:05>[TALK]{virag}but the best?
<14:33:07>[TALK]{strul}after 19 its said to be win
<14:33:13>[TALK]{luwenzhe}but you said "The old theory suggests 11-f9.  But black was not so successful there."
<14:33:21>[TALK]{strul}i think 20 is best defence
