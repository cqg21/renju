<13:34:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today we will begin to learn the tactics of white attack.
<13:34:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}If white has a chance for attack,
<13:34:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white has bigger variety of attacking tools.
<13:35:02>[TALK]{tieuphilac}indeed
<13:35:17>[TALK]{civsnail}no forbidden
<13:35:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}When we learned about the use of lines,
<13:35:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we learned the principle that we should not use the threes or fours unless we have to, or unless we clearly benefit from it/
<13:35:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the same goes for white side.
<13:36:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}even if you are white, try to be wise about using the lines you have.
<13:36:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}besides the tactics of lines,
<13:36:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white has an additional weapon.
<13:36:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is the use of forbidden moves.
<13:37:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white can take advantage of black's forbidden points,
<13:37:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and benefit from it.
<13:37:42>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes, this is one of the most attractive parts of renju
<13:37:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Sometimes the forbidden move helps white to have the win immediately, by trapping the forbidden point.
<13:37:51>[TALK]{civsnail}yes
<13:37:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sometimes, the forbidden move does not give white win,
<13:38:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but it gives something else useful,
<13:38:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}such as good white stones location,
<13:38:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or, tempo.
<13:38:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and getting those smaller benefits, white can turn the game into its favor.
<13:38:54>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HH
<13:38:55>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}II
<13:38:57>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GF

<13:39:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Like in this example,
<13:39:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white plays k6,
<13:39:22>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KF
<13:39:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and taking advantage of 3x3 at j6
<13:39:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which means,
<13:39:44>[TALK]{span}yeah
<13:39:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black cannot play its best move to j7
<13:40:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black would want to play j7,
<13:40:05>[TALK]{luwenzhe}nice
<13:40:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but then j6 is 3x3
<13:40:09>[TALK]{smiling}Cool
<13:40:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so black will play elsewhere than j7.
<13:40:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and that means, white will get both k6 and j6 points.
<13:40:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}right?
<13:40:47>[TALK]{yzhnie}y
<13:40:49>[TALK]{aivo}yes
<13:40:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and that way white gets bigger space.
<13:40:51>[TALK]{shaoping}y

<13:42:40>[TALK]{amitabha}sorry, computer crashed
<13:42:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But by playing here, white ensures both k6 point and j7 point.
<13:42:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which means:
<13:43:00>[TALK]{renjunewbie}y
<13:43:23>[TALK]{Chancewu}Y
<13:43:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white "took advantage of 3x3 at j6", and as a result, got two useful stones k6 and j7,
<13:43:29>[EMOTE]{FIFAWORLDCUP} says hello to everybody
<13:43:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which later is enough for powerful white attack.
<13:43:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, the white tactics is:
<13:44:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to use 3x3 to win directly at forbidden point.
<13:44:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to use 3x3 to gain key points
<13:44:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to use 3x3 to get tempo
<13:44:24>[TALK]{luwenzhe}good points
<13:44:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}furthermore, white can use black's 3x3 for its own defensive purposes,
<13:44:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but we will study white's defense in another lesson.
<13:44:53>[TALK]{civsnail}good tactic

<13:53:24>[TALK]{eastmen}you should thank them.:)
<13:53:25>[TALK]{span}^_^
<13:53:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, from this little story you can see that every beginner will quite soon reach to the level where he can detect the danger of 3x3
<13:53:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and when being white, he can count the vct steps up to 3x3 trap.
<13:54:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, as we know how to win when the 3x3 is just few steps away,
<13:54:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we can move on to second question.
<13:54:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}how to use 3x3 when there is no vct,
<13:54:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or when there is no obvious structure of 3x3 ahead.
<13:54:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is already harder question.
<13:55:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is what brings you to the new level in renju.
<13:55:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to start composing the 3x3.
<13:55:35>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes
<13:55:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it is like the people of stone age
<13:55:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they had to dig the big hole

<14:21:45>[TALK]{shaoping}i12?
<14:21:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Now, i wanted to trap that 3x3 so badly.
<14:22:00>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HK
<14:22:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I played here finally after thinking.
<14:22:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}White is threatning to catch 3x3 again
<14:22:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so here is the tactics:
<14:22:53>[TALK]{civsnail}i6 is also in dangerous
<14:23:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white put the 16th stone to h11, directly threatning the i11 3x3 point, and at the same time creating useful pair 16_10.
<14:23:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, while taking advantage of the 3x3 point, i got a useful 16_10 as a gift,
<14:24:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and that line has a potential to threaten the 3x3 at i6,
<14:24:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}do you see it?

<14:24:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he had just blocked all my ideas.
<14:24:55>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes
<14:25:04>[TALK]{civsnail}yes, indeed
<14:25:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And this is one of the toughest moments in renju -
<14:25:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white usually wastes some materials and good points, and even creates black some new stuff, just in order to create 3x3 trap,
<14:26:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if black succeeds to bypass the trap,
<14:26:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then white is much worse than before.
<14:26:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I started to feel bad about the situation after 17th move.
<14:26:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}My trap had failed,
<14:26:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I began to regret the 16th move.
<14:26:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because now the 17th stone was standing well,
<14:26:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it blocks all white connections, and
<14:26:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}secures the i11 point
<14:27:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which means there is no danger anymore.
<14:27:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Furthermore, that 3x3 has now become a weapon for blacks,
<14:27:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}allowing black to shoot out from there anytime he wants.
<14:27:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and in any direction he wants
<14:27:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}scary eh?
<14:27:38>[TALK]{tieuphilac}yah
<14:27:39>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yah
<14:27:41>[TALK]{tieuphilac}a big pressure
<14:27:52>[TALK]{lar880n}I'm trembling
<14:27:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and white stones are not standing well either,
<14:28:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}2,4,12,8,6... all inside
<14:28:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black has successfully exploited its provocation,
<14:28:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and was now closing to pomising position.
<14:28:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}One had to survive just a little longer.
<14:28:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The lower side space is really good for black,
<14:29:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and white had to worry great deal now.
<14:29:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}My next concern was,
<14:29:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I cannot trap that i11 anymore,
<14:29:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and i cannot just leave it hanging there either, can i?
<14:29:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so I had to deal with it.
<14:30:03>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FH
<14:30:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Maybe here, I thought.
<14:30:13>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IK
<14:30:20>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<14:30:22>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FI
<14:30:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But then just here,
<14:30:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and now white is really bad.
<14:30:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because,
<14:30:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}should white play any careless move,
<14:30:55>[TALK]{luwenzhe}all separated
<14:31:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then i6 is black's power point with vct
<14:31:05>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IF
<14:31:06>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IE
<14:31:20>[TALK]{civsnail}that gives white a bad pattern
<14:31:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and should white play four first, then L8 connection is scary.
<14:31:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and white gets worse and worse.
<14:31:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, as I said, trying to trap 3x3 has always two sides.
<14:31:58>[TALK]{luwenzhe}win or die :)
<14:32:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}One is that maybe the beast will go for meat and falls into trap.
<14:32:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But some beast will just sneakily eat our meat, and still run away.

<15:07:45>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GD
<15:07:48>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FD
<15:07:52>[TALK]{lingdodo}it is just the feeling in all my games
<15:07:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I put the 40th move,
<15:07:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and waited him to resign
<15:08:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}assuming I have 3x3 everywhere
<15:08:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}its impossble that black can stop with 41 somewhere
<15:08:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I still dont have trap,
<15:08:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but when I looked on board after 41... amazing,
<15:08:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no 3x3 in sight
<15:08:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I stared at the board long time
<15:08:56>[TALK]{whte}hehe
<15:08:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then I thought,
<15:09:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this materials is so strong here,
<15:09:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the potential is overwhelming,
<15:09:27>[TALK]{tieuphilac}:-)
<15:09:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it just requires one additional stone from other area
<15:09:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}either white or black stone
<15:09:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and the lower part becomes a winning place
<15:09:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I knew, he would think the same way
<15:10:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he saw I thought a long time
<15:10:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and he started to belive he has a chance to survive
<15:10:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and he knew I was probably going to "add powers"
<15:10:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but bringing some upper force down,
<15:10:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}over the left wing
<15:10:45>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}EL
<15:10:56>[TALK]{tunnet99}next move was nice :P
<15:10:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So I played here.

<15:11:12>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FM
<15:11:13>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}EN
<15:11:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then i get the extra pair what i needed, 42_46..
<15:11:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then i would try to run towards lower side with it
<15:11:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in fact,
<15:11:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i was not sure yet if it helps me or not
<15:11:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but at least he would worry for sure.
<15:11:58>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}

<15:12:00>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<15:12:01>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<15:12:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}knowing the g5 point is like a "time bomb", waiting to explode,
<15:12:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he decided to block it
<15:12:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then the hidden trap came
<15:12:35>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GE
<15:12:36>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GL
<15:12:37>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FL

<15:12:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}such hidden 3x3
<15:13:02>[TALK]{whte}cool
<15:13:07>[TALK]{yyfcsd}what's your feeling when kli put the 43rd stone to g5?
<15:13:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}My thinking was... finally, it was about time..
<15:13:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}how come he can keep making perfect moves
<15:13:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and ruin my traps
<15:13:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so i felt relieved
<15:13:42>[TALK]{tieuphilac}:-)
<15:13:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:))
<15:13:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and my second thought was
<15:14:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}did i really miscalculate the trap
<15:14:21>[TALK]{civsnail}"see you next time?"
<15:14:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then i looked for a while before playing 44 ..
<15:14:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he resigned so quickly,
<15:14:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that surpised me even more..
<15:14:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe a second after my move
<15:14:51>[TALK]{luwenzhe}haha
<15:15:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was a fun game.
<15:15:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now, to summarize all this..
<15:15:12>[TALK]{tunnet99}haa
<15:15:14>[TALK]{tunnet99}:O)
<15:15:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you have learned the tactics of 3x3 in many aspects.
<15:15:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}such as simple vct attack to trap 3x3
<15:15:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or using the 3x3 point to get some good key points or space or tempo...
<15:16:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or trying to build some simple traps, hoping the opponent misses them..
<15:16:12>[TALK]{lar880n}psychology is important, to know your opponent!!
<15:16:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or trying to create advanced traps,
<15:16:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which require lots of psychology and understanding of opponents thinking.
<15:16:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}these are the levels of 3x3 tactics.
<15:16:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}You know your own level right now.
<15:16:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Some day, you will reach them all.
<15:17:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Thank you all for lesson, see you next week!
