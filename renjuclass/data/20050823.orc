<13:34:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Most of you have probably seen all the games,
<13:35:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but it is still interesting to analyse them, because you can also hear about the thoughts and tactics and emotions and all.
<13:35:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we start with small check first.

<13:37:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you know, this World championship was very difficult for me.
<13:37:12>[TALK]{Guest464}I am  here too
<13:37:22>[TALK]{Guest453}....
<13:37:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Although I was emotionally in much better condition than last time,
<13:37:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I had been too busy with organizing of WC,
<13:37:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}therefore I took a big risk,
<13:37:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that my home analyses were not sufficient.
<13:38:33>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes, we all can see it
<13:38:50>[TALK]{Guest453}god bless you
<13:38:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Before championship, I made realistic prognosis,
<13:39:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if all goes normally, I will get the top 3 place.
<13:39:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if unlucky, then outside of top 3.
<13:39:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but if things go well for me, and i have enough strength and some luck, then I may be 1st.
<13:39:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Those were my thoughts before games.
<13:40:00>[TALK]{Guest464}.
<13:40:01>[TALK]{luwenzhe}:)
<13:40:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This time, there were so many strong players.
<13:40:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you know, Sushkov nearly failed to enter the AT,
<13:40:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because he played some unlucky games in QT.
<13:40:41>[TALK]{Guest463}.
<13:40:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Fortunately, he was able to reach AT with 4 pts out of 7 from QT,
<13:41:00>[TALK]{luwenzhe}he's not in good shape at the beginning, maybe
<13:41:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}with better coefficient than Aivo Oll
<13:41:13>[TALK]{Guest462}.
<13:41:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I was glad that he made it to AT.
<13:41:27>[TALK]{Guest465}。。。。
<13:41:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}without his participation, the AT would not be the same
<13:41:35>[TALK]{xiaoxin}?
<13:41:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Sushkov had been 2nd in AT twice before that - in 2001 and in 2003.
<13:41:55>[TALK]{Dragon}xiaoain
<13:42:05>[TALK]{luwenzhe}will be too easy for you then? :)
<13:42:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}No, but I wanted to try my ability among best.
<13:42:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Now we will review my games,
<13:42:54>[TALK]{Guest453}OK
<13:42:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I will tell what happened there and why.
<13:43:09>[TALK]{luwenzhe}that will be more interesting
<13:43:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Because, the game records may have seemed weird for you. :))
<13:43:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so I would have to explain more.

<13:44:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}my first game was with Tord Andersson,
<13:44:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}just like 2 years ago.
<13:44:39>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HI
<13:44:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}My choice of opening followed the tactics,
<13:45:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which I also taught you -
<13:45:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is to understand opponent first, and select the opening accordingly.
<13:45:20>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GI
<13:45:21>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IG
<13:45:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This 5th move may be poor choice for white in general,
<13:45:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but it was suitable against him,
<13:45:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I believed.

<13:46:24>[TALK]{YKS}not 14-e10 this time?

<13:46:33>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Know yourself and know your opponent, you will win 100 out of 100  :P
<13:46:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}14-e10 is too well known,
<13:46:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if i let him into well known variant with black advantage,
<13:47:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then he could force at least draw.
<13:47:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Draw is not a good score against him, I thought.
<13:47:20>[TALK]{YKS}got it . THX
<13:47:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So I needed a win.

<13:47:30>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JF
<13:47:31>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HK
<13:47:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}17 and 19 are standard moves here.

<13:50:16>[TALK]{hobbang}I saw
<13:50:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It is considered to be strong for black,

<13:51:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Andersson surprised me with this soft 27th move.
<13:51:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In the first look I thought it is a weak move,
<13:51:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but the more I spent time, the more I understood it was a wise move,
<13:52:10>[TALK]{Guest464}.
<13:52:15>[TALK]{cy}.
<13:52:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white has to solve 2 main tactical issues.
<13:52:59>[TALK]{yuelee00}。
<13:53:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}1. black has now strong power on both left and right side. How to eliminate both?
2. Eliminating both black powers is not enough, if white wants to win the game.
<13:53:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So I was puzzled and spent lots of time here.
<13:53:42>[TALK]{Guest462}.
<13:53:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}After long thinking, i realized, it is not possible to overplay blacks with solid moves,
<13:54:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so i had to take the chance, and imitate some pseudo-activity
<13:54:18>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}LG
<13:54:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this 28 is a good bluff.

<13:55:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, by playing such 28 here,
<13:55:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i made him think that now the pair 24_26 was free to go,
<13:55:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and its very dangerous up there.
<13:55:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}perhaps he could have tried something very aggressive,
<13:56:00>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}DH
<13:56:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}such as here
<13:56:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but i knew his personality

<13:58:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there are 2 main questions - to attack on right up, or defend on left low.

<14:00:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I dont know how many defense moves are possible here,
<14:01:06>[TALK]{comarck}must defend lower left zone
<14:01:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but i had to consider one aspect while defending.
<14:01:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it is not enough just to defend here.
<14:01:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because if i do,
<14:01:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he will play his last move to up left, and offer a draw.
<14:01:56>[TALK]{skywalker}<~~~厩候\
<14:01:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so i needed the plan which not only defends but helps me to gain tempo somehow
<14:02:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?
<14:02:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so i could go up right myself first
<14:02:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so I had to play a bit more aggressively than usual.

<14:07:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok i tell you.
<14:07:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}40 is the strongest defense,

<14:08:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}indeed, it is strongest for defense purpose - kills all black power.
<14:08:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But the downside is, it doesnt give any white potention.
<14:08:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}potential
<14:08:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which means,

<14:09:33>[TALK]{pzh}y
<14:09:37>[TALK]{comarck}tempo needed i guess 40 is bad

<14:11:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I played here.
<14:12:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this looks like an imitation of the attack on 3x3,

<14:13:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but thats what i had anticipated with my moves 40 and 44.
<14:14:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black has win potential only together with the support of k5 area.

<15:21:12>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}OI
<15:21:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the answer is simple -
<15:21:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in case of corner attacks,
<15:21:31>[TALK]{Torsten}o9 enough + chance to win some more space
<15:21:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if we have many choices for defense,
<15:21:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then we choose the one which is most useful for later purposes outside that corner.
<15:21:57>[TALK]{yboil}To attack
<15:22:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this 86 is the only stone which is defensive enough, and also has some support for lower corner.
<15:22:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but
<15:22:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}too late.
<15:22:13>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KE
<15:22:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he played here, offered draw,
<15:22:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and all hopes were gone.
<15:22:28>[TALK]{yboil}:)
<15:22:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was pity to lose half point here.
<15:23:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but i was not prepared for this tactics.
<15:23:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i was so sure he would fight for win, and expected all kinds of variants,
<15:23:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but he surprised me, by forcing a draw.
<15:23:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It means, next time, if I want to win against him, i have to keep his draw strategy in mind too.
<15:24:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}These were the first 3 games of WC.
<15:24:20>[TALK]{yboil}nice
<15:24:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Next Tuesday, we will continue from here.
