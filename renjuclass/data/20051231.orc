<13:49:36>[TALK]{endlessroad}...
<13:49:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}During December 28-30,
<13:49:57>[TALK]{dongfujia}yue ,attention please :)
<13:49:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there was an international renju tournament in Estonia,
<13:50:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}named "Tallinn Open 2005"
<13:50:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}We have such international tournament every year.
<13:50:25>[TALK]{dongfujia}have heard
<13:50:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This time, we had players from 4 countries.
<13:51:12>[TALK]{Guest641}1
<13:51:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The final standings after 8 rounds were:
<13:51:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I was first with 7 points, and Kozhin from Russia was 2nd with 6 points,
<13:51:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Tunnet was 3rd with 6 points,
<13:51:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and Ants was 4th with 5.5 points..
<13:51:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there were totally 26 players.
<13:52:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The interesting thing was that the tournament was not played by RIF rules,
<13:52:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but was used as a testing tournament,
<13:52:24>[TALK]{dongfujia}?
<13:52:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}for "taraguchi" rule.
<13:52:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}do you know this rule?
<13:52:40>[TALK]{dongfujia}no
<13:52:42>[TALK]{xuwu}y
<13:52:42>[TALK]{chess}YA
<13:52:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it is like a "tarannikov rule".
<13:52:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but, after the 4th move,
<13:53:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black player has one extra option:
<13:53:15>[TALK]{Yue}I don't know the rule
<13:53:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he can place five 5th moves,
<13:53:20>[TALK]{dongfujia}me too
<13:53:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}after which white cannot swap any more.
<13:53:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}such additional option will avoid crazy far-away 4th moves.
<13:53:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}For example:
<13:53:52>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HH
<13:54:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}swap
<13:54:02>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}II
<13:54:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}swap
<13:54:16>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IG
<13:54:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}swap
<13:54:22>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GK
<13:54:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and now,
<13:54:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}for the black player it is difficult to decide what to do..
<13:54:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if he chooses to play next move,
<13:54:49>[TALK]{xuwu}y
<13:54:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then he must find balance
<13:54:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}otherwise opponent will swap
<13:55:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if black player chooses to swap now,
<13:55:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then maybe opponent has prepared a crazy 5th move too
<13:55:17>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IK
<13:55:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}something like that..
<13:55:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then..
<13:55:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}its very hard to decide in short time
<13:55:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}what to do next
<13:55:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so the problem of standard "tarannikov" rule is,
<13:55:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it will let white play crazy 4th move
<13:56:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but in case of "taraguchi" rule,
<13:56:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black can use the additional  option:
<13:56:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}place five 5th moves
<13:56:33>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:56:34>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JH
<13:56:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}here
<13:56:37>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}

<13:56:53>[TALK]{hobbang}..
<13:56:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe here
<13:57:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}all of them are winning 5th moves
<13:57:06>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:57:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so white loses the game
<13:57:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that means:
<13:57:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in case of taraguchi rule,
<13:57:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the white player cannot play crazy 4th moves
<13:57:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and this is good for renju
<13:57:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}do you understand?
<13:57:40>[TALK]{endlessroad}y

<13:57:43>[TALK]{skywalker}y
<13:57:44>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:57:44>[TALK]{dongfujia}agree
<13:57:51>[TALK]{Yue}y
<13:57:53>[TALK]{derkas}yes
<13:58:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, the whole tournament of Tallinn Open was used for testing this rule.
<13:58:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today I will show you some games.
<13:58:11>[TALK]{dongfujia}ok
<13:58:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I will begin with most important game.
<13:58:19>[TALK]{chess}GREAT
<13:58:25>[TALK]{dongfujia}:)
<13:58:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It was played in the last round between me and Kozhin,
<13:58:35>[TALK]{dongfujia}:)
<13:58:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we both had 6 points from 7 games at that moment.
<13:58:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and whoever was going to win that game, was to be the winner of the tournament as well
<13:58:54>[TALK]{sosei}:)

<13:59:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he wrote a renju book before,
<13:59:29>[TALK]{dongfujia}a book
<13:59:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and he also played in AT before

<13:59:49>[TALK]{chess}wa
<13:59:52>[TALK]{dongfujia}at
<14:00:01>[TALK]{xuwu}strong!

<14:00:18>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HI
<14:00:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}after some thinking, i swapped again
<14:00:31>[TALK]{dongfujia}haha

<14:00:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then he played here.
<14:00:45>[TALK]{dongfujia}swap?
<14:00:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I became curious of his plan,
<14:00:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so I swapped again
<14:00:58>[TALK]{dongfujia}:)
<14:00:59>[TALK]{Guest635}...
