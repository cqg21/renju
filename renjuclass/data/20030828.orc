<06:17:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today we will study another game from World Championship final.
<06:18:06>[TALK]{eastmen}.
<06:18:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it is my game with Vladimir Sushkov
<06:18:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I was black and he was white.
<06:18:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}As you know, I lost that game.
<06:18:44>[TALK]{eastmen}second..
<06:18:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Lets study it.
<06:18:50>[TALK]{Chancewu}en...
<06:19:08>[TALK]{luwenzhe}A pity game
<06:19:11>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}II
<06:19:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It started here, I put d3, he kept whites,
<06:19:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I offered 5-g9 and 5-i8.
<06:19:53>[TALK]{eastmen}several thearies like this
<06:20:01>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IH
<06:20:02>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GI
<06:20:03>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JI

<06:20:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}These moves all predicatable
<06:20:30>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes
<06:20:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Then I decided to try the style that I had not played in my previous games.
<06:20:39>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KJ
<06:20:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I used the three to k10.
<06:20:57>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}LK
<06:21:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}There are two possible styles from here:
<06:21:32>[TALK]{Chancewu}h10.k7?
<06:21:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}one is k7, another is h10.
<06:21:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<06:21:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<06:21:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Since h10 is not so often played,
<06:22:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so I decided to use it.

<06:23:50>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IM
