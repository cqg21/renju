<16:39:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}First, I'd like say something on Chinese renju.
<16:40:00>[TALK]{Guest520}ohoh
<16:40:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}As you know, Na Wei is the first people who introduce renju into china. He made the first renju club about 10 years ago.

<16:40:30>[TALK]{Guest513}밐밀밀밀밀
<16:40:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}At that time, ando got his first world champion but still there are not strong Chinese players at that time, even do not know how to win in I7 and D4 opening.
<16:41:09>[TALK]{Guest567}dd
<16:41:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}After so many years development, many Chinese renju clubs are set up and Chinese players become much stronger.
<16:41:31>[TALK]{luwenzhe}:)
<16:41:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But because Chinese players lack opportunity to join the international tournament, their strengths are not fully recognized by other countries' players. And also lacking international tournament experience hinders them growth up.
<16:41:55>[TALK]{Guest552}I agree with you
<16:42:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}They need tough training in international tournament.

<16:43:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}of course.
<16:43:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}there are still many Chinese players studying renju. Most of renjuclass students are come from China.
<16:44:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}There are also many Chinese renju websites such as www.basecity.com, www.ourgame.com or www.263.com and so on. You can find thousands of Chinese playing renju on these websites everyday.There are also many Chinese renju websites such as www.basecity.com, www.ourgame.com or www.263.com and so on.

<16:47:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In the presentation, I'd like to talk about something on e-mail tournament and some of my ideas on renju.
<16:47:43>[TALK]{luwenzhe}That's great! Look forwatd to them :)
<16:47:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I know some of you join the e-mail tournament. E-mail tournament is quite different from real tournament.
<16:48:00>[TALK]{liuwenming}y
<16:48:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But because the game is quite slow and lack the stimulating feeling as playing face to face, not all the players like such style.
<16:49:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Any way it attracts many strong players join the tournament such as ando, tunnet, ants, Reims, Kawamura, Hesengawa and most of Russia renju players.

<16:51:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in e-mail tournament, your opponent has enough time to analysis a pattern. It is almost impossible to count on his simple mistakes to win a game.
<16:52:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}You may have quite different feeling in real game and e-mail tournament. In e-mail tournament, some plain pattern may have very strong attack, and some patter with great advantage but no win.
<16:52:43>[TALK]{Guest493}y
<16:52:55>[TALK]{luwenzhe}very hard to win in email games
<16:53:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Some popular patterns are shown sure lost and some used patterns are picked up and become popular.
<16:53:08>[TALK]{virag}need fortune to win game
<16:53:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Playing in the tournament, I think one must pay attention to two important factors: one is opening choice, the other is calculation. It looks quite simple but is not easily be used in the games.
<16:54:03>[TALK]{liuwenming}y
<16:54:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Let us first clarify some simple concepts before discussing the problem. And we will discuss the difference between real game and e-mail games.
<16:55:09>[TALK]{luwenzhe}good
<16:55:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}When we analysis a pattern, there may be some situations:
<16:55:28>[TALK]{virag}most hardest to choose opening patterm, harder than playing the game :)))
<16:55:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Yes, you are correct!
<16:55:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}1. sure win and sure lost pattern.

<17:01:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Your opponents have enough time to do the study, even he know nothing about it.
<17:01:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In most of cases, your opponents will find another win path, no matter how it complicated. He will do it. So do not try to cheat your opponents in the tournament.
<17:02:02>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yep
<17:02:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But the true things is that We experience a no win feeling in most of cases.
<17:02:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we are finding win but always can not. How to do is a big problem.
<17:03:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}There some situation for no win. We have some choice.

<17:04:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}You may fall into the opening trap by your opponent
<17:05:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}You must calculate many possible defense and choose one of the correct one, very tough, very easy to make mistake.
<17:05:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}no win. No strong attack. The plain pattern for both sides, easy to draw.
<17:05:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}This is another no win case.

<17:38:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Of course ,the most idea case is that have very strong attack. even if no win, you can also make draw.
<17:39:07>[TALK]{Guest509}F5
<17:39:10>[TALK]{sunrain}to play with me hehe
<17:39:15>[TALK]{luwenzhe}but generally the case is, when you fail the attack, you lose

<17:42:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}We must have an intuition to know which pattern is safety, which pattern may have problems.
<17:43:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It is very hard. Maybe you need many training to have the feeling. Only repeating old theory may cause disasters.
