<15:02:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}This game was played in the last round of the tournament between Zhu Jianfeng 4 Dan and Fan Xingchen (celie).
<15:02:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}If Zhu Jianfeng can win the game, he still had the chance to challenge for champion title.
<15:03:02>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GF
<15:03:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But it is strange that he used the 13th move in D11 opening.
<15:03:20>[TALK]{concord2497}forced draw?
<15:03:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}The 13th move can be seen as a signal: " Oh, I want a draw, Let's play smoothly!"
<15:03:32>[TALK]{Mogwai};)
<15:03:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In email games, many games with the similar position end with a draw.
<15:03:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But on the other hand, I think in short time games, the variants after this 31st move are too complicated to find comfortable position for both sides.
<15:03:50>[TALK]{hobbang}:)
<15:04:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So anyway, it is not as easy as one expected to find draw position in real games.
<15:04:12>[TALK]{concord2497}so, Black decide to take the chnace?
<15:04:21>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Because in many cases, the position can become very sharp if any tinny mistake happened.

<15:09:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}The 51st move is a obvious signal for a draw.
<15:09:30>[TALK]{konjin}shit connection, i lost the best part :(
<15:09:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Although white got tempo and had some activities on the board, but not enough for a win, especially in such a short time.
<15:10:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}And finally, Zhu Jianfeng got 7 points and won the 2nd place while his biggest opponent: WuHao 6 Dan won the last round and got Champion title with 1 point advantage.
