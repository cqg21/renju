<16:38:42>[TALK]{casar}^^
<16:38:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}For example, next week, on June 1, you can enjoy Mr Kawamura's lesson,
<16:38:49>[TALK]{Aurora}congratulations,YY
<16:38:51>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and June 8, Mr Yamaguchi's lesson
<16:38:51>[TALK]{span}congratulations,yy!
<16:38:51>[TALK]{callings}great
<16:39:00>[TALK]{endlessroad}great:))
<16:39:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The teacher from june 15 will be decided by yyfcsd
<16:39:12>[TALK]{Padovan}wow :-)
<16:39:18>[TALK]{celie}:)
<16:39:30>[TALK]{casar}it will be exciting lesson
<16:39:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes, and students will be more active also since june,
<16:40:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because 1 month idle rule will apply for all renjuclass members -
<16:40:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if the idleness of a student (no cp change) is more than 30 days, the name will be erased from list.
<16:40:43>[TALK]{Guest153}oh
<16:40:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, students must be constantly active, to stay alive in renjuclass
<16:40:52>[TALK]{Analyze}y
<16:40:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it will give good opportunities for new members to join.
<16:41:00>[TALK]{endlessroad}:)
<16:41:01>[TALK]{Padovan}does it mean that teachers will correct all the hws in time as well?
<16:41:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<16:41:12>[TALK]{Padovan}:-)
<16:41:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}even teacher cannot correct all in time,
<16:41:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}teacher can check what hws were received,
<16:41:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and at least add the sending cp (1 cp) first
<16:42:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and later add the remaining cps
<16:42:02>[TALK]{Padovan}:-)
<16:42:08>[TALK]{AUTHOR}good news
<16:42:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then it will solve the idle check problem,
<16:42:15>[TALK]{bm}:)
<16:42:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and gives some time for teacher, if he is too busy
<16:42:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}is it ok for yy and lu?
<16:42:37>[TALK]{yyfcsd}yes
<16:42:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the idle time counter will be shown in student list,
<16:42:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}behind each student name,
<16:42:55>[TALK]{luwenzhe}sure
<16:43:00>[TALK]{casar}hi
<16:43:02>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so please check your status then regularly,
<16:43:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and if your idleness is approaching to 30 days, then be careful
<16:43:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}any questions?
<16:43:56>[TALK]{Padovan}are there any exceptions? e.g. if a student explains before the 30 days 
<16:44:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes, basically it is possible to make exceptions.
<16:44:25>[TALK]{luwenzhe}we can discuss in detail later, maybe
<16:44:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the system will select the list of expired names to be deleted,
<16:44:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and waits for RT confirmation
<16:44:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}RT has a right to uncheck some names before submitting deletion
<16:44:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, if someone is in some vacation,
<16:45:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or some problem, and it has been agreed with RT,
<16:45:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he can get some short extension
<16:45:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}ok
<16:45:25>[TALK]{bm}:)
<16:45:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}at least, now you are aware of idea.
<16:45:33>[TALK]{yyfcsd}yes
<16:45:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the clock will start ticking from june 1.
<16:45:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<16:45:46>[TALK]{shuwang}any new department taught by RT?
<16:45:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}RT resigns from Analyses department,
<16:46:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but it doesnt mean I will never teach there.
<16:46:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I will occasionally teach in Analyses and maybe even Theory dept,
<16:46:28>[TALK]{span}good
<16:46:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but my focus will be for advanced students of renjuclass from now,
<16:46:36>[TALK]{bm}great
<16:46:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and offer them special Lab
<16:46:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it will be explained more in June

<16:48:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today, one more game about Team WC.
<16:48:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}What you see on the board is a famous Russian gambling variant.
<16:48:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Most of Russian team's players used it quite often during Team WC,
<16:48:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and were rather successful.
<16:48:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}For some reason, their opponents failed to win as black one after another,
<16:49:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and whats even worse - they losed so fast, sometimes in less than 20 moves.
<16:49:18>[EMOTE]{span} faints
<16:49:31>[TALK]{moocheng}yyfcsd vs killer21
<16:49:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The variant was based on concept:
<16:49:37>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GG
<16:49:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This 5th is sure win, so they would not keep it.
<16:49:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And whatever would be alternative,
<16:50:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}would become a game move.
<16:50:04>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<16:50:05>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IG
<16:50:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Since until recently, the theories claim 5-i7 to be win also,
<16:50:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}they decided to challenge these claims
<16:50:30>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JG
<16:50:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}with this 6th move.
<16:51:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Some gamble style lovers, such as Chingin, Klimashin have made some deep analyses here.
<16:51:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So for the start,
<16:51:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}is anyone here in this room who knows black win here?
