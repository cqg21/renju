<13:48:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}There Andersson played there and got very good position later.
<13:48:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}However, the difference between 3rd and 4th round was perhaps 2 hours.
<13:48:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I did not have time to analyse this 34th move.
<13:48:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It is too risky move to play it without proper analysis.

<14:08:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Very strong everywhere.
<14:08:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I came to conclusion that if I let black attack, I would lose the game.
<14:09:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So I needed the miracle, to save white.

<15:08:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I wanted to create something new here,

<15:10:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}33 - follows the plan, created by 29

<15:11:04>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}DD
<15:11:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He keeps defending with best moves.
<15:11:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And now,
<15:11:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I thought about 1 hour and 30 minutes for next move
<15:11:24>[TALK]{okabe}Didn't he spend more than an hour in 34?
<15:11:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He spent about hour on 36

<15:26:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}very logical moves.
<15:26:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}when I counted it,

<15:27:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, time was ticking.. 10,9,8... on clock..
<15:27:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i had to decide... how to begin.
<15:28:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so much black power
<15:28:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}just need to start somehow
<15:28:16>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JI
<15:28:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i played a four..
<15:28:24>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JK
<15:28:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but after writing down the move,
<15:28:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and looking on board, the time was still too few..
<15:28:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}finally, 5,4,3..
<15:28:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}last look at clock, 2,1..
<15:29:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then i had to throw a stone, to avoid loss, and immediately hit clocks.
<15:29:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but for my unlucky, i missed the spot.
<15:29:24>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KC
<15:29:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it dropped here.
<15:29:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the most unlucky stone.
<15:29:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}making self overline :(
<15:29:47>[TALK]{okabe}mayber pass was better...
<15:29:47>[TALK]{hobbang}:(
<15:29:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}pass was better.
<15:29:55>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<15:29:57>[TALK]{xuwu}what a pity
<15:30:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}On the board, there are 173 draw spots.
<15:30:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}2 win spots
<15:30:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and 3 loss spots
<15:30:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in 1 second, i was able to find the loss spot
<15:30:50>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KL
<15:30:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is 1 loss spot
<15:30:55>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<15:30:56>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IB
<15:30:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is the other

<15:31:01>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KC
<15:31:05>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and this is the 3rd
<15:31:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no more lose moves
<15:31:12>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}CE
<15:31:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}now i was trapped by 3x3
<15:31:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because h6 is dead
<15:31:31>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}CC
<15:31:31>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FB

<15:31:46>[TALK]{xuwu}y
<15:31:49>[TALK]{hobbang}y
<15:31:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, my sure win became sure loss in 1 second.
<15:31:57>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<15:31:58>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<15:32:12>[TALK]{farmer}just 3 seconds far from win.
<15:32:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but next day, when i analysed the game with mr yamaguchi,
<15:32:18>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<15:32:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he said, only a strong master can find the loss move in 1 second.
<15:32:41>[TALK]{okabe}:P
<15:32:46>[TALK]{xuwu}:)
<15:32:48>[TALK]{pzh}...
<15:32:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}most players need maybe 1 hour to find where is loss move, exvept for i2
<15:32:51>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<15:32:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<15:33:09>[TALK]{skywalker}blinding spot ^^
<15:33:11>[TALK]{SamSite}that must have been a comforting phrase
<15:33:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}hahaha, i was so angry to myself,
<15:33:29>[TALK]{xuwu}this loss move is very hard to  find  :)
<15:33:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}for not keeping enough safe time on clock.
<15:33:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}i wanted "clean win" so much,
<15:33:38>[TALK]{Guest497}.
<15:33:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so i spent much time on 35.
<15:33:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?
<15:33:51>[TALK]{SamSite}so, a question
<15:34:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so that my new theory of 29 could be a glorious example
<15:34:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes?
<15:34:17>[TALK]{SamSite}if Stefan played so many "only" moves, can you consider 29+31 to be black win ? :)
<15:34:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}After game, Stefan said:
<15:34:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sometimes it takes a "sacrifice" to prove a new win method.
<15:34:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He means, even though it was tragic for me,
<15:34:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the move 29 proved itself
<15:35:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to be super good move
<15:35:31>[TALK]{SamSite}so 30 should be like f5
<15:35:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Hard to tell.
<15:35:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I have not had time to analyse all.
<15:35:58>[TALK]{okabe}Just like statesman's saying...
<15:36:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But this game was better tactics for black than any other development in the past

<15:37:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this move is also a question

<15:38:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}seems not easy for white
<15:38:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Stefan said,
<15:39:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe this game proved black win in i11
<15:39:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He said it half-seriously,
<15:39:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but he had some reasons in it
<15:39:25>[TALK]{SamSite}yes
<15:39:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, most innovative and beautiful game turned to be my only loss game in AT.
<15:39:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So ironic fate.
<15:39:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<15:40:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The lesson is over, Thank you all.
<15:40:10>[TALK]{SamSite}it would've been too perfect, if won
