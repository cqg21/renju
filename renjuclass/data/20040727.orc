<16:37:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}At the beginning, the newspaper was supported it.
<16:38:10>[TALK]{leto}like in Go :)
<16:38:15>[TALK]{swordblue}1962
<16:38:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}That newspaper also supported Meijin Sakata-Gozui
<16:38:58>[TALK]{wolfzhou}Sakata-Gozui??
<16:39:24>[TALK]{fantasy}Did he invent the SAKATA rule? :)
<16:39:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}However, after Sakata died, that sponsor  cancelled the support Meijinsen.
<16:40:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Mr. Sakata-Gozui is the 5th forever Meijin. not as Sakata-rule.
<16:40:32>[TALK]{fantasy}Ah ....
<16:40:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}He was so strong and loved.
<16:40:47>[TALK]{sparko}oh..
<16:41:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}He loved renju too.
<16:41:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}The most important person at renju history.
<16:41:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}We think so.
<16:42:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}One of his puple is Mr. Nishimura.
<16:42:34>[TALK]{luwenzhe}oh
<16:42:53>[TALK]{swordblue}wow
<16:42:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Meijinsen had stopped at 1974 suddenly.
<16:43:03>[TALK]{Fermat}Japanese top ten league1974~1980 (held 7 times)?
<16:43:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Yes..
<16:43:17>[MOVE]{findfind}HH
<16:43:20>[BACK]{findfind}
<16:43:52>[TALK]{zero}why then it stopped?
<16:43:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Instead of Meijinsen, top ten league wa s held at first.
<16:44:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}The reason is suponsor run away.
<16:44:30>[TALK]{zero}ah...thx
<16:44:57>[TALK]{virag}money is important
<16:44:58>[TALK]{luwenzhe}see
<16:45:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But for the renjufan, top ten league was very interesting.
<16:45:21>[TALK]{wolfzhou}agree virag
<16:45:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Because including meijin(Mr. Isobe) took part in that tournament.
<16:46:06>[TALK]{Guest364}1
<16:46:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}And the rule was interesting at that time.
<16:47:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Of course not color change.
<16:47:20>[TALK]{wolfzhou}choose opening by counting stones?
<16:47:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I5 opening was allowed for the first time.
<16:47:32>[TALK]{Guest361}.
<16:47:48>[TALK]{amanda}........................
<16:47:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}24 opening was adopted.
<16:48:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Until 12th Meijinsen, 21 opening
<16:48:54>[TALK]{ouzo}i hope i can come back to that year
<16:49:06>[TALK]{GrandMaster}1st time, in 1974, Mr. Isobe won with 9-0 socore!!
<16:49:24>[TALK]{zero}...
<16:49:24>[TALK]{wolfzhou}so strong
<16:49:28>[TALK]{Fermat}wow!
<16:49:41>[TALK]{virag}hmmmm with I7 or D4 opening?
<16:49:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But I think 2nd time, at 1975, means 2 big meanings.
<16:50:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}One is Mr Isobe lost the game.
<16:50:07>[TALK]{Fermat}Nakamura won
<16:50:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}2nd is Mr. Nakamura won that tournament for the first time!
<16:50:55>[TALK]{wolfzhou}he's much stronger
<16:51:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Nakamura won this tournament and after that, got Meijin title.
<16:51:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So it was his debut tournament.
<16:51:32>[TALK]{wolfzhou}i've heard that he won 13 times in Meijin tournament..
