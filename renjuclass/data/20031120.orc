<14:41:38>[TALK]{whte}no
<14:41:51>[TALK]{bergamot}no
<14:41:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Ilyin was one of the greatest renju players ever in Russia.
<14:42:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Unfortunately, he distanced from active renju in around 1997.
<14:42:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He has achieved a lot in renju.
<14:42:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Ilyin and I are in about same age,
<14:42:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he is a few months older than me.
<14:43:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}We first met when we were 15 years old.
<14:43:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}At that time, I lost to him.
<14:43:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Ilyin showed constant progress,
<14:43:47>[TALK]{luwenzhe}wow, so young
<14:43:54>[TALK]{luwenzhe}why did he give up renju?
<14:43:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and reached the peak of his career in 1995.
<14:44:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In the World Championship 1995,
<14:44:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}after 8 rounds (total is 11),
<14:44:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he had 7,5 points
<14:44:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and was superior leader of the whole tournament.
<14:44:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Mr Kawamura and I were far behind him.
<14:45:10>[TALK]{luwenzhe}but
<14:45:10>[TALK]{virag}Ilyin was strong fighter
<14:45:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}At that moment his dream was very close - almost everybody started to think he will win the WC 1995.
<14:45:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But he lost his last 3 games.
<14:45:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}To me, to Nara, to Ants.
<14:45:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So unlucky.
<14:45:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}If he had won at least one of the three,
<14:45:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he would have won the WC title.
<14:46:08>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Estonians broke his dream
<14:46:10>[TALK]{Guest537}.
<14:46:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But even though he did not reach his biggest dream,
<14:46:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}he proved everyone how strong he is,
<14:46:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and how big potential he has.
<14:46:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Next year, there was the team WC,
<14:47:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}where Ilyin played on the first table of Russian team.
<14:47:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Russia became Team World Champion.
<14:48:07>[TALK]{luwenzhe}strong team
<14:48:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}This was also the first time Chinese players took part in international tournament.
<14:49:02>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Na wei?
<14:49:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes,
<14:49:10>[TALK]{virag}hehe
<14:49:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Na Wei,
<14:49:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and two others,

<14:49:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Deng
<14:49:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yes
<14:49:38>[TALK]{luwenzhe}:)
<14:50:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Anyway, it was the last time I had a chance to meet Ilyin.
<14:50:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Soon after that he retired from renju, because he had to move to another city, to enter university.
<14:50:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He had no time for renju anymore.
<14:50:44>[TALK]{virag}Na wei broken Ilyin career :)
<14:50:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But maybe he will come back.
<14:51:00>[TALK]{luwenzhe}hope so
<14:51:05>[TALK]{virag}we hope
<14:51:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And he will show us is power again.

<14:51:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Today's game is from the 1996 Team World Championship.
<14:51:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I picked one of his win games.
<14:52:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}He is black.
<14:52:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And who was the white loser?
<14:52:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<14:52:37>[TALK]{yyfcsd}yamaguchi:))
<14:52:40>[TALK]{luwenzhe}haha
<14:52:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}no.
<14:52:53>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yamaguchi had retired at that time.
<14:53:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}yamaguchi didnt play during 1992-2000.
<14:53:37>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}any other guesses?
<14:53:45>[TALK]{luwenzhe}Hope not you :)
<14:53:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}well, it was me. :))
<14:54:01>[TALK]{luwenzhe}ah~~~

<15:46:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I had played good moves until this moment,
<15:46:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but now I began to play poorly.
<15:46:40>[TALK]{luwenzhe}ehh
<15:46:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Just when got the chance to do something,
<15:46:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I became weak.
<15:46:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It often happens so.
<15:47:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Especially, when you spend lots of time on defense,
<15:47:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe 2 hours,
<15:47:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and when you succeed,
<15:47:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}you have no strength to focus once more,
<15:47:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to seek for advantage
<15:47:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so you kind of relax,
<15:47:50>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}when you balance the game.
<15:47:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}That happened to me in this game.
<15:48:06>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IJ
<15:48:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I played here.
<15:48:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Bad move.
<15:48:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}First of all,
<15:48:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}black had no attack power at i10,
<15:48:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because white's defense structure nearby was good already.
<15:49:01>[TALK]{Guest537}y
<15:49:10>[TALK]{tianxia}:)
<15:49:11>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}And I wasted a tempo.
<15:49:14>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<15:49:14>[TALK]{renjunewbie}K3
<15:49:15>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}LF
<15:49:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}If move 28 immediately here, then he does not have too many choices.
<15:49:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I might get that i10 point while he gets some weak point at the same time.
<15:49:55>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<15:49:57>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}EH
<15:50:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Or, if to defend,
<15:50:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}then defend the real area,
<15:50:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}where something may happen later.
<15:50:33>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, as for defense, 28-e8 was good,
<15:50:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and as for attack,
<15:51:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}something on right wing would be good,
<15:51:09>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in condition that the right wing move is a VCF threat.
<15:51:11>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}

<15:52:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Anyway, I chose the poorest move.
<15:52:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<15:52:30>[TALK]{tianxia}:)
<15:52:34>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}28-i10 looks poor.
<15:52:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and it is poor.
<15:52:42>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<15:52:50>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KC
<15:53:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Now, black could play k3,
<15:53:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and kill my right wing power,
<15:53:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}having his left wing potential still available.
<15:53:35>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}See how one poor move can chance the course of the whole game.
<15:53:47>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}LF
<15:54:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I played an active 30 now, but too late.
<15:54:02>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}MF
<15:54:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Black controls the situation.
<15:54:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Furthermore, I made things worse for myself with that attack.
<15:54:55>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IL
<15:55:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Now I continued my plan that I made with move 32,
<15:55:09>[TALK]{luwenzhe}ehhhh
<15:55:11>[TALK]{virag}last try to attack
<15:55:30>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I should have defended at e8 still.

<16:07:12>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and got a loss from him.
<16:07:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}It was a good lesson to me,
<16:07:22>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}about careless 28
<16:07:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}:)
<16:07:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, now, we will end the lesson.
