<13:32:20>[TALK]{xinxin}hi
<13:32:22>[TALK]{hallo}HI,GM
<13:32:24>[TALK]{Whiz}hi.GM
<13:32:25>[TALK]{mima}hi gm
<13:32:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}last weeks, GM Liu has been guiding us into the world of i3 opening
<13:32:38>[TALK]{konjin}yes
<13:32:40>[TALK]{StarRain}hi gm
<13:32:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}unfortunately, he is not available today for lesson duty
<13:32:42>[TALK]{xuwu}y
<13:32:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so I agreed to fill in
<13:33:01>[TALK]{luwenzhe}lucky we have you!
<13:33:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}my first assignment in this department
<13:33:10>[TALK]{YKS}he can not be here last week.
<13:33:15>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HH
<13:33:16>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}II
<13:33:17>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JH
<13:33:20>[TALK]{konjin}we are sure yiu can fullfill it !
<13:33:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}GM Liu has been introducing you with 4-i7
<13:33:33>[TALK]{konjin}you
<13:33:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}he will probably continue it later I think
<13:33:57>[TALK]{Guest271}。。
<13:34:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I was asked to introduce another 4th move
<13:34:26>[TALK]{chess}4th move i7 best?
<13:34:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}since I lack the touch with this opening, I had only one choice
<13:34:33>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JG
<13:34:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this is today's  topic
<13:34:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}As Ando pointed out to me,
<13:35:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is different from 4-h7
<13:35:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}much
<13:35:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}because the edge is closer to stone 3 than to stone 1 in case of 4-h7
<13:35:51>[TALK]{konjin}yes, edge effect
<13:36:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I am hoping,
<13:36:20>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that all of you will join this discussion actively today,
<13:36:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}because there is no true leader present
<13:36:31>[TALK]{slamduk}:)
<13:36:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}most of you know probably more than me :)
<13:36:57>[TALK]{Torsten}That is a true Grand Master :)
<13:36:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so let's share our knowledge and thoughts
<13:37:07>[TALK]{endlessroad}:)
<13:37:14>[TALK]{xuwu}y
<13:37:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}we will focus on 2 5th moves here
<13:37:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}which ones are they ?
<13:37:40>[TALK]{konjin}i7
<13:37:42>[TALK]{endlessroad}i7
<13:37:43>[TALK]{YKS}i7 and h9?
<13:37:45>[TALK]{YeYuwuziqi}i7  h9
<13:38:08>[TALK]{xuwu}I7
<13:38:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<13:38:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}since konjin was so quick, we begin with i7
<13:38:27>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IG
<13:38:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what is your feeling of this move
<13:38:59>[TALK]{chess}two 2
<13:39:17>[TALK]{konjin}seems as i7 with 3-5
<13:39:20>[TALK]{Torsten}white may play h6 now and start a defensive pattern
<13:39:34>[TALK]{konjin}and big chances to be black win
<13:39:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ok good, others ?
<13:39:58>[TALK]{YKS}this triangle seems strong for Black
<13:40:23>[TALK]{konjin}i mean i7 oppening
<13:40:30>[TALK]{YKS}h6 seems natural.
<13:40:38>[TALK]{Guest276}。
<13:40:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes
<13:40:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}let's explore the natural looking defence h6
<13:40:53>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HF
<13:41:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now, before we go on here,
<13:41:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I will demostrate you immediately
<13:41:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}one difference between 4-h7,j7
<13:41:49>[GOTO]{GrandMaster}003
<13:41:51>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HG
<13:41:51>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IG
<13:41:52>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JF
<13:41:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}same pattern
<13:42:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this is from a game I found
<13:42:10>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KI
<13:42:11>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LJ
<13:42:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black played natural continuation
<13:42:22>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FH
<13:42:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and then went wide into space
<13:42:46>[TALK]{Guest269}。
<13:42:50>[TALK]{YKS}9-g8 seems much natural??
<13:43:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}moves 2,4,6,8 are pretty separate
<13:43:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}with 9-g8 there is more risk of being surrounded maybe
<13:43:31>[TALK]{chess}y
<13:43:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now, we will not focus on what's best here
<13:43:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}just to show the difference of 4th moves at h7,j7
<13:43:57>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GH
<13:43:58>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FI
<13:43:59>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FJ
<13:44:02>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EI
<13:44:04>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GG
<13:44:04>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GI
<13:44:05>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}DI
<13:44:05>[TALK]{YKS}I just noticed some play 9-g8, then 11-i10, etc,...
<13:44:06>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EG
<13:44:06>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}DF
<13:44:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now, in the game
<13:44:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black managed to get a strong attack
<13:44:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}using move 9-f8
<13:44:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}there is still much space on left side
<13:44:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and black won the game
<13:45:10>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EH
<13:45:11>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EF
<13:45:12>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}DG
<13:45:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}like this
<13:45:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}got wins on both sides
<13:45:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}you may explore this later at home more detailly :)
<13:45:51>[GOTO]{GrandMaster}003
<13:45:53>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JG
<13:45:54>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IG
<13:45:54>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HF
<13:45:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the same attack here
<13:46:01>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GI
<13:46:01>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FJ
<13:46:02>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LH

<13:46:09>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}MG
<13:46:09>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}NF
<13:46:16>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and the edge is there already !
<13:46:20>[TALK]{luwenzhe}yes
<13:46:21>[TALK]{endlessroad}y
<13:46:33>[TALK]{YKS}yes
<13:46:38>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now the other win pattern in previous variant is out of the question
<13:46:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I have not had time to analyse this way yet
<13:47:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so you will investigate now  :)
<13:47:33>[TALK]{GrandMaster}can you find even win

<13:47:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ok
<13:47:53>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}MH
<13:47:59>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}MF
<13:48:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and then ?

<13:48:51>[TALK]{deity}where is win? i can not see it :(

<13:57:27>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LF
<13:57:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}great
<13:57:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so in this case we avoided edge effect as black
<13:57:58>[GOTO]{GrandMaster}013
<13:58:00>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JF
<13:58:06>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}KI
<13:58:08>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}NI
<13:58:09>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}MG
<13:58:09>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}NF
<13:58:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what about now
<13:58:20>[TALK]{Torsten}interesting :)
<13:58:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}that previous 13th was from the game I saw
<13:58:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in the game this 14th wouldn't have saved
<13:58:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}because of 4-h7
<13:58:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and more space fro black then
<13:59:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now, pair 9_13 is not active
<13:59:03>[TALK]{YKS}this 14th may worth trying.
<13:59:07>[TALK]{Guest319}。
<13:59:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}therefore black power on right side is not so big
<13:59:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}as it would be with 4-h7
<13:59:31>[TALK]{Torsten}18-18 a must?
<13:59:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}no
<13:59:47>[TALK]{YeYuwuziqi}18-18 =?
<13:59:50>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:59:50>[TALK]{konjin}wonderfull 14  !
<13:59:51>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JJ
<14:00:01>[TALK]{Torsten}yes 14 great :)
<14:00:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}black can not win here either
<14:00:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}14 is not the greatest here, the edge effect of 4-j7 is :)
<14:00:44>[TALK]{Torsten}(18 - 18 once stands for a move number , and once for a stone pointer)
<14:00:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if this would've been a preparational play, it would have been perfect
<14:01:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}ok
<14:01:31>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so in conclusion here
<14:01:52>[TALK]{GrandMaster}atleast with this 5th move there are clear differences between 4th move in h7/j7
<14:02:00>[TALK]{konjin}with this 18, black can not win on the right isn't it?
<14:02:10>[TALK]{YKS}and 4-j7 better than 4-h7??
<14:02:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}is it better ?
<14:02:45>[TALK]{GrandMaster}of course it depends
<14:02:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}is the white player prepared
<14:02:52>[TALK]{konjin}maybe not better, black can chose left side attack ?
<14:03:01>[TALK]{GrandMaster}or does the black player miss the edge effect
<14:03:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}many possibilities
<14:03:16>[GOTO]{GrandMaster}006
<14:03:25>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GI
<14:03:26>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FJ
<14:03:37>[TALK]{Guest311}。
<14:03:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}surely black is free to experiment here
<14:04:10>[TALK]{timur}what about 9 f8?
<14:04:20>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FH
<14:04:23>[TALK]{YKS}or 9-k8?
<14:04:54>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GH
<14:04:57>[TALK]{GrandMaster}passive 10
<14:05:07>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LH
<14:05:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe now black could have some chances
<14:05:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}pair 7_9 helps some sure
<14:05:33>[TALK]{casar}.
<14:05:36>[TALK]{Guest319}。
<14:05:52>[TALK]{YeYuwuziqi}10I8?
<14:05:56>[TALK]{luwenzhe}9-1-3-11 interesting
<14:05:56>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:05:57>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:06:02>[TALK]{konjin}i think 9-10 better, avoid the white horse-step 10
<14:06:16>[TALK]{chess}y
<14:06:19>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:06:19>[TALK]{chess}agree
<14:06:20>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GH
<14:06:32>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FH
<14:06:41>[TALK]{GrandMaster}can white play 10 here
<14:07:03>[TALK]{konjin}if white 10 g8, black is difficult to make 5 in any direction because of horse step moves
<14:07:30>[TALK]{Torsten}10 might work
<14:07:43>[TALK]{Guest315}10I8?
<14:07:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here is risks
<14:07:58>[TALK]{Guest311}。
<14:08:27>[TALK]{sunrain}whose risks.=)
<14:08:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}direct playing might result in surrounding by whites
<14:08:35>[TALK]{Torsten}exactly
<14:08:45>[TALK]{Torsten}black must try subtle moves now
<14:08:56>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FI
<14:09:06>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EI
<14:09:07>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GG
<14:09:09>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GF
<14:09:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}not so good maybe
<14:09:43>[TALK]{Guest319}/
<14:09:48>[GOTO]{GrandMaster}010
<14:10:02>[TALK]{konjin}agree
<14:10:03>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and now using space on right side might be harder
<14:10:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}10 is also connecting 6 and 8 to each other in a way
<14:10:45>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:10:45>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:10:46>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FH
<14:10:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}whreas 9 here separates whites better
<14:11:15>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but
<14:11:28>[TALK]{GrandMaster}is this enough for black
<14:11:38>[TALK]{Torsten}10 - i8?
<14:11:41>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IH
<14:11:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}10-i8 separates blacks
<14:11:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}meaning, right side is now less useful for black
<14:12:12>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if left side attack fails,
<14:12:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is troubles for black
<14:12:40>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and the reason is making 9 to left side
<14:12:50>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:12:50>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:12:51>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}LH
<14:12:58>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if you go straight here,
<14:13:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}white must follow ?
<14:13:29>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and black gets some action to right side already
<14:13:32>[TALK]{casar}.
<14:13:42>[TALK]{Guest311}。
<14:13:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}move i11 can be very important in this kind of variation
<14:14:03>[TALK]{xuwu}am i late?

<14:15:58>[TALK]{Guest319}。
<14:15:59>[TALK]{Torsten}i like this 13 myself
<14:16:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now black has something on both sides
<14:16:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}if he could connect,
<14:16:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}then he could get winning chance
<14:16:37>[TALK]{alicecooper}no
<14:16:37>[TALK]{alicecooper}again lags
<14:17:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this 5th is rather hard
<14:17:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and we only looked at one 6th
<14:17:55>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it seems to me, that black power lies here in diagonal developments
<14:18:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}stones 9,13 use the stones 1 and 3 effectively in creating space on sides
<14:18:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}7_13 and 7_5 are important diagonal structures
