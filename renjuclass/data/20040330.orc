<16:43:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}here black goes here.
<16:43:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Eventually, black wins everywhere in this 5th move.
<16:43:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that makes the 4th move be a serious gamble.

<16:44:06>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<16:44:36>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The reason why some white players such as Nekrasov play the gamble variant is that black win is very difficult in some cases.
<16:45:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In fact, I might need to think long time myself, before making the proper win way.
<16:45:20>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Fortunately, in serious tournaments there is enough time to find win,
<16:45:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but in ORC 5 minute games I may easily fail.
<16:45:34>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}FI
<16:46:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}I don't know Ants Soosyrv's mind at the moment of 7th move.
<16:46:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}For some reason he hesitated to play traditional 7th move which should bring win.
<16:46:21>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Do you have any idea why?
<16:46:40>[TALK]{luwenzhe}He thought may there's a trap for him?
<16:46:41>[TALK]{virag}yes

<16:47:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Nekrasov opened, Ants swapped
<16:47:45>[TALK]{Xespok}so it could be a well-studied variant by N
<16:47:55>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there are several traps indeed.

<17:57:51>[TALK]{yyfcsd}the difference between 14-j9 and 14 k9: if 14-k9 then 15-h7 17-j9, seems black can defence, and if 16-j9 and then 18-i6, then the stone at h9 may help black defence. and in the variant of 14-j9, no such problem.
<17:58:36>[TALK]{yyfcsd}in last variant, h9 stone force white to block the three on the top and then black win in lower side
