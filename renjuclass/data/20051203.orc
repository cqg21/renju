<13:48:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}The Meijin, Norihiko Kawamura v.s. the challenger Kazuto Hasegawa
<13:48:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the first 2 games were
<13:49:25>[TALK]{Guest266}.
<13:49:27>[TALK]{GrandMaster}tentative black showed their usual tactic and tentative white defeat
<13:49:36>[TALK]{GrandMaster}now the score was 1:1
<13:49:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe todays game was the most important one
<13:49:53>[TALK]{Guest266}.
<13:50:14>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Some of you know, nowadays Mr. Hasegawa always put D3
<13:50:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}(todays tentative black was Mr. Hasegawa
<13:50:37>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But he showed...

<13:52:53>[TALK]{hobbang}possible i7 or i8
<13:53:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}In the last World Championship
<13:53:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Mr. Yuuki Oosumi (Kamo Yuki) played it many times in QT and BT
<13:53:35>[TALK]{Yue}What's your viewpoint of this 6, GM?:)
<13:53:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It is old old tactic in Japan
<13:54:10>[TALK]{Yue}Oh. see.
<13:54:18>[TALK]{dongfujia}too old :)
<13:54:24>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Some people says it was already solved
<13:54:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But the young player pays attention it and analysed
<13:55:07>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and use it against Mr. Hasegawa in this Meijin-sen tournament
<13:55:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}The result was Mr, Hasegawa's winning, but he spend a lot of time
<13:56:04>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Mr. Hasegawa always put D3 even in local tournament
<13:56:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But this Novenber, he tried this opening
<13:56:45>[TALK]{Guest266}`
<13:56:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}D3 continuation was broken
<13:57:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It is the question for people don't know this 6
<13:57:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}where do you want to play in 7?
<13:57:34>[TALK]{Yue}i8
<13:57:36>[TALK]{hobbang}i7 or i8
<13:57:38>[TALK]{dongfujia}i8
<13:57:42>[TALK]{setfocus}i7
<13:57:43>[TALK]{skywalker}i7 seems better
<13:57:56>[TALK]{endlessroad}i7
<13:58:05>[TALK]{alicecooper}both seems good at first look
<13:58:09>[TALK]{xsir317}i7
<13:58:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}I8 is natural
<13:58:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and not so bad
<13:58:18>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IH
<13:58:18>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HG
<13:58:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and next?
<13:58:35>[TALK]{hobbang}maybe i7?
<13:58:46>[TALK]{GrandMaster}some moves are possible. but
<13:58:54>[TALK]{GrandMaster}It is so far from win for black
<13:59:09>[TALK]{GrandMaster}a bit narrow
<13:59:13>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:59:13>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<13:59:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}then
<13:59:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}someone said, i8 is said the best move
<13:59:33>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IG
<13:59:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}you are great :)
<13:59:48>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GH
<14:00:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}8 is just a tactic, so the best or not is not problem
<14:00:05>[TALK]{Yue}is 8-g8 strongest?
<14:00:18>[TALK]{Yue}oh.
<14:00:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}of course there are more possible moves
<14:01:02>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but please search it yourself :)
<14:01:22>[TALK]{GrandMaster}what is your guess of the next move?
<14:01:32>[TALK]{Aurora}F7
<14:01:33>[TALK]{Yue}if me, I will play at f7
<14:01:37>[TALK]{xsir317}f7 or i 10
<14:01:40>[TALK]{out}i10
<14:01:45>[TALK]{Yue}but kawamura played at a new point:)
<14:01:49>[TALK]{shuwang}f7
<14:01:50>[TALK]{hobbang}f7
<14:01:53>[TALK]{Aurora}J6
<14:01:58>[TALK]{mayhem}F7

<14:02:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Yue can be today's teacher :)
<14:02:16>[TALK]{Yue}:P
<14:02:27>[TALK]{dongfujia}:)
<14:02:39>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Your guess is good, natural and nice moves
<14:02:47>[TALK]{xsir317}H5?
<14:02:51>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but Mr. Kawamura spend 50 minutes here
<14:02:58>[TALK]{dongfujia}oh !
<14:02:59>[TALK]{Yue}very long time.
<14:03:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}the time control was 210 1/1
<14:03:37>[TALK]{xsir317}every player have more than 3 hours?
<14:03:47>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Maybe Mr. Kawamura know this 8 and know the theory
<14:03:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Yes
<14:04:10>[TALK]{GrandMaster}both have 210 minutes, 3.5 hours
<14:04:17>[TALK]{dongfujia}clever :)
<14:04:34>[TALK]{xuwu}.
<14:04:42>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but He tryed surprise move
<14:04:42>[TALK]{hobbang}what is kawamura's idea?
<14:04:45>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}HE
<14:04:49>[TALK]{GrandMaster}here!
<14:04:56>[TALK]{xsir317}i got it!!!
<14:05:08>[TALK]{GrandMaster}in the phase until 8th
<14:05:10>[TALK]{xsir317}:)
<14:05:12>[TALK]{Yue}xsir317 can be meijin:)
<14:05:23>[TALK]{dongfujia}xsir is nice
<14:05:30>[TALK]{GrandMaster}there were 2 lines of white
<14:05:31>[TALK]{yuelee00}ho~
<14:05:41>[TALK]{setfocus}why take this move?
<14:05:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but he didn't stop anything
<14:05:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}control it!
<14:06:17>[TALK]{GrandMaster}it is fact but H5 is one of the key point in D12 opening
<14:06:17>[TALK]{Yue}a surprising move.
<14:06:26>[TALK]{GrandMaster}but in this phase, amazing idea
<14:06:56>[TALK]{GrandMaster}until 8th was Hasegawa's tactic, but he spent 100 minutes for the next move!
<14:07:03>[TALK]{dongfujia}!
<14:07:08>[TALK]{dongfujia}hen
<14:07:18>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But this lesson has only 63 minutes :P
<14:07:18>[TALK]{hobbang}oops
<14:07:53>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So you have to guess within 100 SECONDS :P
<14:08:21>[TALK]{dongfujia}o1 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ a 15
<14:08:23>[TALK]{alicecooper}G9?
<14:08:27>[TALK]{xsir317}maybe f9
<14:08:54>[TALK]{Yue}xsir317 is 9 dan + meijin!
<14:08:55>[TALK]{Guest266}.
<14:08:56>[TALK]{hobbang}f7 is natural?
<14:09:02>[TALK]{skywalker}haha
<14:09:09>[TALK]{Yue}I will play at f7.
<14:09:23>[TALK]{out}i too
<14:09:24>[TALK]{Samsone}h7?
<14:09:26>[TALK]{hobbang}f9 is so bad move..
<14:09:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}your majority seems to be F7
<14:09:35>[TALK]{dongfujia}bad?
<14:09:38>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FG
<14:09:38>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}EF
<14:09:41>[TALK]{Yue}f9 is 9 dan's move!
<14:09:43>[TALK]{GrandMaster}and then?
<14:10:00>[TALK]{xsir317}then white still have to defense
<14:10:09>[TALK]{hobbang}h6?
<14:10:14>[TALK]{Whiz}not so good maybe
<14:10:19>[TALK]{hobbang}umm
<14:10:28>[TALK]{skywalker}white will be surrounded by black
<14:10:42>[MOVE]{hobbang}HF
<14:10:55>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}FE
<14:11:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}difficult for white
<14:11:30>[TALK]{hobbang}yes
<14:11:32>[TALK]{GrandMaster}(maybe)
<14:11:50>[TALK]{GrandMaster}thanks hobbang
<14:11:53>[BACK]{GrandMaster}

<14:11:53>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:11:54>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:12:00>[TALK]{GrandMaster}My guess was

<14:12:02>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IH
<14:12:03>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GJ
<14:12:04>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JE
<14:12:16>[TALK]{setfocus}:)
<14:12:19>[TALK]{GrandMaster}this moves
<14:12:20>[TALK]{Yue}:)
<14:12:35>[TALK]{GrandMaster}why I guessed it was
<14:12:37>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:12:38>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:12:38>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:12:38>[BACK]{GrandMaster}

<14:12:41>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GE
<14:12:42>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IH
<14:12:43>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GJ
<14:12:43>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JE
<14:13:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}maybe it was Mr. Hasegwa's tactic, same as Mr. Oosumi used
<14:13:17>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:13:17>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:13:18>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:13:18>[BACK]{GrandMaster}

<14:13:22>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}IH
<14:13:23>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}GJ
<14:13:23>[MOVE]{GrandMaster}JE
<14:13:59>[TALK]{GrandMaster}so it was easy to find for Mr. Hasegawa and seems to be possible, black controled
<14:14:05>[TALK]{GrandMaster}(maybe)
<14:14:25>[TALK]{GrandMaster}But these moves are
<14:14:48>[TALK]{GrandMaster}into black's position, defencive moves
<14:15:13>[TALK]{GrandMaster}So if white can play in his position, upper side, it will be better
<14:15:16>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:15:17>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:15:18>[BACK]{GrandMaster}
<14:15:44>[TALK]{GrandMaster}Hasegawa's 100 minutes thinking made

<14:16:01>[TALK]{Yue}seems this 10 stops nothing...
<14:16:11>[TALK]{GrandMaster}yes, try to control
<14:16:16>[TALK]{out}brain break..
<14:16:23>[TALK]{GrandMaster}As a result, it was bad one
<14:16:29>[TALK]{dongfujia}:)
