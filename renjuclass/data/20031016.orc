<13:32:20>[TALK]{claire}that make sense now leto ..thanks
<13:32:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}to block the open line, or to fill the potential development point of opponent
<13:32:23>[TALK]{LiuJianping}I guess 7-H10
<13:32:47>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}sometimes one method is good, sometimes another.
<13:33:17>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}In such open distribution of stones,
<13:33:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the existing open line is very powerful,
<13:33:32>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}especially if it is a white line
<13:33:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is why there is only one block possible.
<13:33:47>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HI

<13:41:26>[TALK]{leto}:)
<13:41:26>[TALK]{Guest058}i'd like to
<13:41:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}About the moves,
<13:41:38>[TALK]{Guest058}but i never do the homework
<13:41:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}indeed, both h7 and h10 are possible.
<13:41:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Isobe played h7,
<13:41:48>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HG
<13:41:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}which is the best white move.
<13:42:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The basic tactics tells us
<13:42:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}move h10 is better than h7
<13:42:26>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}why?
<13:42:27>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:42:29>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HJ
<13:42:32>[TALK]{claire}make a line too
<13:42:39>[TALK]{claire}two ...actually
<13:42:41>[TALK]{luwenzhe}blocks black and develops self
<13:42:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}good
<13:42:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}both claire and lu correct
<13:42:50>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:42:51>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HG
<13:42:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}while h7 just blocks
<13:42:57>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:42:57>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HJ
<13:43:03>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}h10 blocks also, + two self lines
<13:43:13>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}by the basic tactics, h10 is better move.
<13:43:18>[TALK]{virag}but depend on opening pattern
<13:43:24>[TALK]{virag}in I1
<13:43:28>[TALK]{virag}white attack ok
<13:43:38>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But in general, block + two lines is better than block + no lines
<13:43:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}agree?
<13:43:48>[TALK]{virag}z
<13:43:49>[TALK]{claire}but h7 looks more actively balance the down space ...
<13:43:49>[TALK]{virag}y
<13:43:54>[TALK]{LiuJianping}y
<13:43:56>[TALK]{tianxia}yes
<13:43:57>[TALK]{Guest058}agree
<13:43:58>[TALK]{leto}y
<13:44:03>[TALK]{yzhnie}y
<13:44:07>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}There are exceptions in renju also,
<13:44:16>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that comes from the opening structure
<13:44:25>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and it is good to know such exceptions
<13:44:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this is one of them.
<13:44:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}The white's activity looks good here at first,
<13:44:41>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}IK
<13:44:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but unfortunately white does not have win here.
<13:45:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and in the end, when white's attack is failed,
<13:45:08>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there will be difficulties below later
<13:45:14>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so, considering all this,
<13:45:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}the white chooses 8-h7,
<13:45:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and defend first
<13:45:29>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and wait for the attack chance later
<13:45:38>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:45:38>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:45:39>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HG
<13:45:56>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So, the deep and farsight tactics tells us to go h7
<13:46:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}another example:
<13:46:08>[CLEAR]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:46:09>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HH
<13:46:09>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}II
<13:46:10>[TALK]{Guest058}but now i think black 9-h10 is very goog
<13:46:10>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GG
<13:46:11>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HI
<13:46:14>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GI
<13:46:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}here, block + two lines
<13:46:19>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:46:20>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JI
<13:46:24>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}here block + no lines
<13:46:36>[TALK]{Guest058}y
<13:46:36>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:46:36>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}GI
<13:46:39>[TALK]{luwenzhe}y
<13:46:43>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we know the basic tactics,
<13:46:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it should be good at g9
<13:47:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}but somehow it is not a good timing
<13:47:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and it turns out after deep analysis, that it was better wait,
<13:47:18>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and then attack later
<13:47:19>[BACK]{RenjuTeacher}
<13:47:20>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}JI
<13:47:28>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}thats why 5-j9 is strongest
<13:47:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}But these situations happen rarely.
<13:47:46>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Most cases, many lines = yummy

<13:53:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}9 is a space move, makes black line, and takes away one key point of whites (imagine white at i11, making two white lines)

<13:57:52>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}move 12-g8 is good only if black cannot go g10 after that,

<14:01:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this one is no block + 3 lines
<14:01:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}in basic tactics,
<14:01:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there was a method

<14:02:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}this 13th move seems to control white's pair.
<14:02:15>[TALK]{Guest069}oh~

<14:21:33>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}HK
<14:21:36>[TALK]{Guest058}black with F7 and E8 is too strong
<14:21:40>[TALK]{tianxia}white have threat
<14:21:40>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}Indeed, white has to defend actively
<14:21:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that was also Isobe's move.
<14:21:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}So far, all theory.
<14:22:00>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}How about 17?
<14:22:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}not very logical move
<14:22:08>[TALK]{leto}i know(:

<14:22:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}by the way, in theory class you learned the variant with 90 degrees rotation
<14:23:04>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so for someone it may be hard to look the new angle
<14:23:19>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}maybe someone turned their monitor on the side on their desk?

<14:29:39>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was necessary to play 20-k10 in defense purposes

<14:29:48>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}if just for defense,
<14:29:50>[TALK]{Guest069}20g6
<14:29:59>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}white could play 20-j6 or something

<14:30:23>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so,
<14:30:25>[MOVE]{RenjuTeacher}KJ
<14:30:31>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}when Isobe played here,
<14:30:45>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}there are only two possible reasons:
<14:30:46>[TALK]{Guest058}21 then ?
<14:31:06>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}1. he did not notice the black's counte-rattack with 21-g6
<14:31:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}or
<14:31:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}2. he noticed it all, but he counted even further, and decided black's counter-attack is not dangerous, and in the end black's attack will jam, and then white can enjoy the benefits of 20th move.
<14:31:57>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}understand?
<14:32:13>[TALK]{yyfcsd}y
<14:32:15>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and I believe Isobe thought of the 2nd reason
<14:32:16>[TALK]{leto}hardly (:
<14:32:22>[TALK]{tianxia}so fearfulness?
<14:32:23>[TALK]{claire}ya
<14:32:44>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}because white's right side space looks yummy

<14:51:27>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}move 20 created such a good base for white,
<14:51:41>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}so black had to spend all the resource to reduce the power of 20
<14:51:49>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and even play the additional defense 41
<14:51:54>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}and give up the tempo.
<14:52:01>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}that is the "value" of 20th move

<14:52:53>[TALK]{luwenzhe}great Isobe
<14:52:58>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}we can just think, if 20 was a passive move,

<14:53:10>[TALK]{RenjuTeacher}it was maybe safe idea,
